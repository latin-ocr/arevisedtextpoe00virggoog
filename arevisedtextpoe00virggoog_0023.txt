some oi the tenth, retain the correct form3 but about the end
of the tenth century the latter seems to have entirely yielded its
place.

The cause of this change seems to have been thet the monis
of the mediaevul period, many of whom devoted themselves to
the copying of claseieal manuscripts, took a fancy to substitute
“Virgilius ” for ‘⁴ Vergilius.” They probably thought that there
was little differente in sound between the e end the i, und that

their new spelling of the poet’s name was more in keeping with

some of their notione about its origin and significanoe. For in
the fourth Eelogue he had sung, as they believed, of the Divino
Son of the Vtrotm the Messiuh prophesied in the same poem
was the uirgo, or branch oi J esse and David3 moreover, the poet
was the mugioian of the golden braneh, or aureo uirgo of the

sixth book of the Aeneid* And therefore the name was trans· ·

formed into Virgilius. This change of one letter, which seemed
to them, and which seems to many of our own day, so trivial,
would be received almost as en outrage in the case 01 any living
or recent author. Suppose, for example, we should write Tin·
nyson for Tennyson, or Spiuser for Spenser, would there not be
every gen ersi protest?

In the oldest MSS, the “Vettium'' or “Romen'' und the ·

“Mediocan,” dating from the fourth and fifth centuries, we find
in the textos the fourth Georgic, v. 563, Vergilium, and inveri-
ably the genitive Vergili iu the oft-repeated formula of the copy-
ists, used to mark the end and beginning of the several books-
as at the end of the second Georgic: “ P. Vergili Maronis Geor-
gicon lib. ll. expltieitus), incipit lib. Ill. feliciter.‘' So, too, the
name of the poet several times occurs in tbe fine palimpsest MS.
of Pliny, of the fourth century, published by Sillig as the fifth
