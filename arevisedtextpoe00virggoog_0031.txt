Horace are in 00 danger. The Aeneid istoc grand, 100 beautiful,
too pure, to be despised‚ 0011100101, 01 1001.

lt is replete with all the qualities which are essentiel to agraet
work 01 art. It is great in conception and invention. lt is won-
derfully diversified in soenes, incidente, 101 characters, while it
never departs from the vital principle 01 unity. 11 10 adorned
with 110100011101100 and imagery 01 which language is capable.
ln discoursing 01 great achievements and great events, it never
eomes short 01 the grandeur which befits the spic style; in pas-
seges 01 grief and suffering it takes hold 01 001 sympathies with
all the power 011110 most affecting tragedy. What aaublime epia
01 110011 10 the account ot' the sack 01 Troyl what a tragsdy 01
passion and 1110 10 presented in the story 01 Didol Indead, the
student will find in the Aeneid many dramatis scenas, many vivid
pictores 011110 and manners, many lively narratives 01 adventure,
any one 01 which would be 01 110011 a poem, 101 would secure to
its author an enviable fame.

01 the praeminent worth 01 Vergil's poema, and 01 their 110-
portancs as literary studies, the most striking proof ia presented
in the fact that so many 01 the 0110010001 modern poetry, in all
cultivated languages, have manifestly been produced under the
moulding and relining influence 01 thia great master 01 the ert
Dante, who 1011 all ths power 01 “ the Mantuan,'’ ascribes to him
whatever excellence he has himself attained in beauty 01 style;
and, in the gsnerous avowal 01 his indebtedness, he utters one 01
the noblest eulogies ever bestowed by any poet upon a brother
poet:

“Oh degli altri poeti onore e lunae,
Vagliami ’l lungo studio, e’l grande amore,
Che m’ han 11110 001011 10 100 volume3
'lu ae' lo mio maestro e lo mio autore:

’10 00’ 0010 colui, da cu’ ic tolsi
bo bello stile, clue m‘ha 11110 00010,” ¹*
