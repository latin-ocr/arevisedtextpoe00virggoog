xiv msa sal> walenses OF VERGIL-

But though liable to such criticisms, the Eclogues are among
the most graceful and beautiful of all idyllic poema, and they pos-
sess a charm which laseinates the reader more and more with
every perusal.

The Eclogues established thereputation of the poet, and gained
him at once ardent friends and admirere among the most power-
ful and the most cultivated of the Romans. Among these, be·
eides his early and fast friend Pollio, were Octavian, Maecenas,
Varius, Horace, aud Propertius. These and all other educatae
Romans ol the day regarded Vergil as already superior in many
respects to any poet who had yet appeared. lt was most ol all
in the exquisite linish and harmony of his hexameters that he ex-
celled all who had preceded him. The hexameter verse had been
first introduced into the Latin language, at the close ot the second
Punic war, by the soldier and poet Ennius. But though ‹listin-
guished by originality, strength, and vigor, the poetry of Ennius
was harsh and rugged to a degree which rendered it to the more
cultivated tustes of later generations almost intolerable. Nor by
the poete who succeeded Ennius had any such improvement been
made in the compositiones Latin verse as to admit ot any oom-
parison between them and their Greaian models. It was reserved
for two grem poets of Rome, two congenisl spirits, filled with the
most lively admiration oi each other, laboriug side by side, both
atriving earnestly for the same object-it was reserved for Vergil
and Horace to elevate the national poetry to a character worthy
of Rome, to develop all the resources of their noble langnsge, and
tc make it flow both in heroic and lyrie verse with all the grace
and dignity that had hitherto been characteristic of the Greek
alone.

Alter the publication of the Eclcgues, Vergil appears to have
passed the remainder of his life chiefly at Naples. His ieeble
health was probably the occasion of this.

It was here that he composed the Georgius, a diductio poem
in four books, in which he endeavors to recall the Italicas to their
primitive but long-neglected pnrsnit ol agriculture. In pointel
versification this is the most finished of the worlrs of our poet,
and, indeed, as Addison remarks, it may be regarded as in this
