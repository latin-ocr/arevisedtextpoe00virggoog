PREFAOE.

Tun text here presented ie the result ol a carefnl comparison
oi the older editions, especially those of Heyne, Jahn, and For-

biger, with those of Ludwig, Ribbeck, and Conington, more
recbntly published. In the twenty years since the isene oi my
editiones “The Aeneid, with Explanatory Notee‚” important
changes have been made in the orthography oi the Vergilian
text. The labore ol Riteehl and Brambach have done much
toward establishing a correct and unilorm Latin orthography
for schools, and also a characteristic orthography ior the texts
of authore belonging to different periode. The improved and
more accurate-forms of spelling due to these and other distin-
guished scholare, have been based partly on the authority of the
Roman grammariane, and partly on the critical study of monu-
mental and nuruiematic inscriptione and the best existing manu-
scripts, ln former investigatione ol this kind too much weight
was given to the manuscripts, none oi which probably date
back earlier than the fourth century of our era, while inscrip-
tions contemporary with the best perinde oi the language‚ and
presumably representing the orthography of euch periods, were
lest more or less ont of view.

Giving proper consideration to monuments of thie latter
kind, without losing sight or the prevailing forms of spelling
