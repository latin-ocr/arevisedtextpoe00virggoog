tude found 1111111000 in the beautiful hymn called the fourth
Eclogue, in which he hails the auspicions times J'ust dawuing on
tbe world, and initiated bytho consulship of his friend aud patron
Pollio in n. c. 40. The sixth Eclogue was composed in the 101-

lowing year, n. c. 39, in fuliillmcnt of a promise made 10 Varus*
The eighth was written in the autumn of the same year in honor
01 Ρο1110, who had gained 1 brilliant victory over the Parthini, a
people of Dalmatia. The two remaining Eologues, the seventb
and tenth, were probably composed in the two following years.

Though the material ο1 the Bucolica is taken largely from
Theocritus, and to some extent from other Greek poets, yet Ver·
gil has given to most of them something of a national character
by associating this foreign material with circumstances and per·
1001111 perteining to his own time and country. ln the first and
ninth Eclogues, for example, he describes with deep feeling, in
the dialogues of the shepherds, the social miserias attending the
wars 01 the triumvir-ate, and in the fourth he dwells with delight
on the anticipated return of peace and blessedness under the reign
of Octavian. In the first, again, he finds, or rather makes for
himself, the opportunity oi expressing bis grateful love and ad-
miration of the youthful emperor, while in the fifth he commem·
crates,under the name 01 Daphniatlre greatness and the untimely
death of the deilied (111111. Finally, in the sixth and tenth, in
the midst of myths and fancies derived from his Grecian masters,
he has immortalized the name 01 bis friend Cornelius Gallus.

The scenery of the Eclogues, as well as the manners and cue.

given these poems 1 11111 10010 foreign air by the use 01 Greek iu-
stead of Italian names. But this was the taste of the times. He
1110111110, under another disadvantage, as compared with The-
ocritus, in the want of aLatin dialect suitable for shepherds and
herdsman, or, at least, in 001 employing one. While the Sicilian

Greek pastoral generally uses 1 form cf speech approximating ’

closely to the nature of its rustic characters, the language of Ver·
gil’s shepherds is 100 much like that of cultivated society.
