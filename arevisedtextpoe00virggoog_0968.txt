METHOD. By WM. R. flattena, Ph.D., and wn. E.

The new method employed in these two books for beginning the

study of Latin or Greek is that followed by Professor Harper with such

signal success in his classes at Chautauqua and elsewhere. A sentence
of the original text is first placed before the pupil. The pronunciation

· and exact translation of each word are fumished him. With the aid

which the teacher gives him in advance, and with the material given in
the book, he thoroughly masters the words and phrases of this sentence
or section. His knowledge is tested by requiring him to recite or write
the Greek or Latin sentence, as the case may be, with only the trans-
lation before his eye.

With this as tlre foundation. and with adequate notes, the words
are transposed and introduced in various relations, and by thus follow-
ing a thoroughly inductive method‚ a knowledge of the languageis
obtained in much less time than that usually required.

The book is a gulde to the language-nota companion to the
Grammar. The pupil deals with the language. He discovers a prin-
ciple in the sentence before him. He observes and remembers He

⁸ does not leam what he mayor may not observe hereafter. He thus

creates for himself a working grammar of essential principles and adds
at each step what is then needed.

Most introductory Latin books prepare for Caesar, yet they are
often made up of different authors, different styles, and different vo·
cabularies. This Latin book is based wholly upon the first bookof
the Gallie War, and insures a thorough dn'll upon the words, construc-
tionS, and idioms of Caesar. Systematic instruction is given in reading
Latin in the order of the text. This, and the attention given to word
study, give proficieney in sight reading.

The lessons in the Greek Method cover Book I. of Xenophon’s
Anabasis‚ and include a formal study of almost every portion of the
Grammar. Special attention is given to review, lessons for the purpose
being frequently inserted.

Among the special features are: the entire absence of everything
not essential, its thoroughness, and the genuine interest it arouses in
the pupil. It holds his attention, quickens his mind, and makes the
study of the langnage pleasant for him and his teacher.

Capies osthe above books will be mailed, partpar'd, to any addrm, on recet'fl
os price. Full desmptive circulars sent on application.
