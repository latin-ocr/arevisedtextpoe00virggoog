Vergil ie largely eonjeotural. Ι would, therefore, prefer to
write thie olaee of words in the form which, no doubt, Quin-
tilian end his contemporaries used in making new copies of
Vergil, following the spelling whiph Angustus seems to have
preferred, and giving ns everywhere suoh forms ae orateur, oi-
oee, dipem, and volverat, rather than oolnoe, vive, divom, end
rolooet; and my reason would be the seme ee theirs, hemely,
that the true eoued was nearer u then o. lt was, perhaps, a
usage ol o kindred to that in our English eeigttor, ordor, and
the like. But, on the whole, l have felt oonetralned to defer
to the authority of those who heve aoeees to original doon·
mente, and to admit these forms into the text to some limited
extent. Ι have therefore adopted, at least for the present, the
eo spelling in oolgre, ortem, voltur, in oott and ootteh oi the
verb eolo, andin the genitive plural ending vom, ae in divom
and Argivom. Bnt the nominative and aeeosat-ive endinge eoa
and omn of the second deelension‚ the forms quotve and quot

oi the relative pronoen, geom for eum, and the verbal endings
eret and voratur, for poet and venter, end the partieipial end-
ingentem ior euhoe, Ι have not employed. Also, Ι have used

the ending imon in superlativeS, eneh ae moeimew and opti-

mos, and in some ordinale, as decimor, rather than the older
forme optemus, meeumee, and decerem. The ending emer in
eneh words leads to error in pronunciation3 so muoh, indeed,
that it wee rejeoted by ansar, who substituted imos, an inno-
vation generally adopted by subseqnent writers. ln the treat-
ment οἰ theee elaeses of words my text will be found very
. nearly like that of Ledewig.*
