volume of bio edition ot Pliny'e Natural History, where it ie uui·
tormly Vergilius.

The eorreot torm was known to tbe learned Politianua ot
the fitteeuth century, and was restored iu several of the earliest
printed editione ot tbe worlrs ot Vergil, both italien und Ger-
man, but the monkiah authority wau too strong tor them.

Nearly holt a century ago German philologists began onoe
more to write the nume in its proper form. The earliest exam·
ples I beve tound are in Fickert’e Pliny, 1842, and Obbarius'e
Prudentius, 1845. The German philologieal magarinus soon
adopted both Vergilius and Vergi13 Vergilian editore, ae Freund,
iu 1851, and ludewig, in hie edition ot 1854, ventured to use the
eorreot form, aud the example wau followed by the editors ot
Latin clemins generally; eo that the miespelled word hae now

ι disuppeared from nearly all German philologieul end olaedoel

writinge, exeepting old publicatione, and reprintu of old editions.

In Englund and Amerioa the eorreoted Latio torm is used
by ull the beet authorities, auoh ae the Latin grammate ot Roby,
Harkneee, and Gildersleeve, the Horpers’ Latin Diotionary, rep1

resenting the ueholership ot Short and Leuis, und other eminent
Latinists, the Conington edition of Vergil, by iar the foremoet

⁴ English edition ot the present century, and by the American

Journo ot' Philology. Many, indeed, still udhere to the Enp-
tot torm, while admitting the proper spelling in Latin. But,
ot eouree, the ineongruity oi Vergilius and Virgil oon not long
be tolereted, and the letter, oe in Germany, must epeedily follow
ite cognate of the dark aget.
