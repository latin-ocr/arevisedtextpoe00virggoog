which Ifind in none before, is a complete representation of
all the proper and personal names found iu the text. Forthis
Ι am indebted chiefly to the list appended to the smaller edi·
tion of Ribbeck.

In the first edition of my Aeneid, pubHshed in leco, Ι called
attention to the proper spelling of the name Vergilium which,
indeed, at that time, had already been ascertained and adopted

are found many, probably all, examples of the family name on

form, in one single example Virgilia is used instead of Vergilia.
