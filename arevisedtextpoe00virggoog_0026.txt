reckoned among his earlier productione, are ascribed to him on
very insufficient grounds. The Eclogues were begnn about n. c.
42, at the nequest of O. Asinius Pollio, who was then acting as
the lientenant of Antony in Gaul. Pollio was himscli distin-
guished as a poet, and not less as a scholar, orator, and historian.
Under his patronage the second, third, and tiith Eclogues had
already been written, when the literary labora and the peacel'ul
life of the poet were suddenly interrupted. The veteran legions
of Octavian, on returning from Philippi, and demanding the allot-
ments oi land which had been promised them asa reward for
their eervices in the civil war, were authorized to take possession
of eighteen Italian cities, with the district cf country pertaining
to each. Tbc citios thus treated were those vbich had espoused

reception given him by the emperor on this occasion which in-
spired the grateful and glowing eulogy contained in the first
Eclogne, written in the summer cs n. c. 41.

Alter tbe close oi the Perosian war, the Mantuam country was
again disturbed by the demands of the veterane, and our poet in
vain, though at the risk oi his life, attempted to maintain his
rights against the centurion Arrius Fleeing again for snccor to
Octavian, he was reinstated, though not without lonaaud anxious
deity, in the possession cf hie farm. During this period of dclay
and depressing uncertainty, in the autumn oi n. e. 4¹, hc wrote
the ninth Eclogue, in which he bewails his unhuppy lot. But on
